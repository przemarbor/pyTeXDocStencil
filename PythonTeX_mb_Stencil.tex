\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

\section{Examples of pythontex commands, their usage and/or description}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\verb|begin{pycode}| -- executes the code inside the environment. If any \verb|print| function is run inside it, the results of printing are printed 
-- code is executed and not typeset

Example:

\begin{verbatim}
# This is not executable part of the document! It's only a text in verbatim!
\begin{pycode}
a = 123.45
s = 'This is string'
b = a+2

print(b)
print(s)
\end{pycode}
\end{verbatim}

produces:

\begin{pycode}
a = 123.45
s = 'This is string'
b = a+2

print(b)
print(s)
\end{pycode}


\item 
\verb|begin{pysub}| -- " useful for inserting Python-generated content in contexts where the normal \verb|\py| and \verb|\pyc| would not function or would be inconvenient due to the restrictions imposed by LATEX. Since Python processes $\langle code \rangle$ and performs substitutions before the result is passed to LATEX, substitution fields may be anywhere."

{\bf I stumbled upon the errors when depythonizing the source while having \verb|\pysub| environment in it}. That is why \verb|\pysub| code is commented out in this document.

%\begin{pysub}
%a = 123.45
%s = 'This is string'
%b = a+2
%
%!{print('AAAAAAAAA')}
%
%print(b)
%print(s)
%\end{pysub}

\item 
\verb|begin{pyverbatim}| -- like \verb|begin{verbatim} + begin{pycode}| -- code is typeset and not executed

\item 
\verb|begin{pyblock}| -- the same as \verb|begin{pycode}| but the code inside the environment is additionally printed 
-- code is typeset and executed

\item Examples with \verb|\py, \pyc, \pyb| 

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|\py| -- prints out the value of the variable or the command, provided it can be stringified

\py{a}

\py{10*2+4}

\py{s}

\item \verb|\pyc| -- inline version of \verb|begin{pycode}|

-- execute, not typeset

\pyc{1+1}

\pyc{print(1+1)}

\pyc{print(a)}


\item \verb|\pys| -- prints out what is inside of the braces (kind of verbatim environment) -- like \verb|\begin{pysub}|

\pys{1+1}

\pys{a}

\pys{print(a)}

\item \verb|\pyb| -- like \verb|\pys| but it colourizes the printout

\pyb{1+1}

\pyb{a}

\pyb{print(a)}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Examples of usage of mbpytex auxiliary functions}


\subsection{Pretty printouts of numpy/sympy matrices}

\subsubsection{numpy}
\begin{pyblock}
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1,2,1],
              [0,3,1],
              [2,1,1]])
              
v = np.array([[2],
              [0],
              [1]])
              
b = A@v
\end{pyblock}

Since the following lines 
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{pycode}
from mbpytex.mbpytex import *
\end{pycode}
\end{verbatim}
are included at the beginning of the document, now we can write

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\left[
\py{matrix(A)}
\right]
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
%%%%or
%%%%\begin{verbatim}
%%%%$\py{matrix(A)}$
%%%%\end{verbatim}

which produces

\begin{equation}
\left[
\py{matrix(A)}
\right]
\end{equation}

%%%%$\py{matrix(A)}$

\vspace{0.5cm}

We could even latexify pythontex commands like this! (see the beginning of the file) and hide pythontex under the latex commands:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\mtx}[1]{\py{matrix(#1)}}
\newcommand{\mtxb}[1]{\py{bmatrix(#1)}}
\newcommand{\mtxp}[1]{\py{pmatrix(#1)}}
\end{verbatim}

Then we could use \verb|$\mtxb{A}$| to typeset the matrix.
% $\mtxb{A}$
{\bf But } there are problems with depythonizing documents with commands like the ones above. So, more versatile solution would be to avoid using those commands.

%% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

\subsubsection{sympy}

We can do sympy calculations in plain \verb|\pyblock| after importing numpy:
\begin{pyblock}
from sympy import *

x = symbols('aa')
k = Symbol("k")
As1 = Matrix([[k,2,1],
              [0,k,1],
              [2,1,k]])

ss = latex(As1)
\end{pyblock}

and access the variables in the same way as above: $\py{ss}$

But we can also use special environments with \verb|sym| prefix added, like \verb|sympyblock|. There are two remarks that need to be made here:
\begin{itemize}
\item The difference in usage between those two approaches is that in \verb|sympyblock| there is no need to import sympy. It is imported by default like if we used ''\verb|from sympy import *|'' in \verb|pyblock| environment.

\item Commands \verb|sympyblock| and \verb|pyblock| are run in {\bf two different sessions}. So the {\bf variables from the one context are not accessible from inside the other one}.
\end{itemize}


\begin{sympyblock}
# no need to import sympy. It is already done by sympyblock environement!

k = Symbol("k")

As2 = Matrix([[1,2,1],
              [0,k,1],
              [2,1,1]])
              
vs2 = Matrix([[2],
              [0],
              [1]])

bs2 = As2@vs2
bs2 = As2 @ vs2
\end{sympyblock}

Now, with \verb|\sympy{latex(As2)}| we can obtain:
$\sympy{latex(As2)}$.

Remember, that now you cannot do:
\verb|\sympy{latex(As1)}| or \verb|\py{latex(As2)}| because \verb|As1| was created in the context of \verb|\py| environment, and \verb|As2| was created in the context of \verb|\sympy| environment. 

Since we want to have homogeneous access both to numpy and to sympy libraries, in \verb|mbpytex| we assume that the main document context is \verb|\py|/,\verb|\pyblock|/\verb|\pycode|, etc... and we need to import both numpy and sympy libraries explicitly in it.

\section{Summary - cheat sheet of mbpytex library}

\subsection{Matrix typesetting}
Use: \verb|\py{m2l(matrixname)}| command or its less concise versions \verb|\py{matrix(matrixname)}|, \verb|\py{matrixb(matrixname)}|, \verb|\py{matrixp(matrixname)}|..., regardless whether you have numpy or sympy matrix.

$\py{m2l(np.array([[1,2,1],
               [0,3,1],
               [2,1,1]]))}$
$\py{m2l(sp.Matrix([[1,2,3],
                 [2,3,4],
                 [3,4,5]]))}$

\begin{pycode}
A = np.array([[1,2],
               [0,3]])

x = np.array([[1],
               [0]])

b = A @ x
S = sp.Matrix([[1,2],
               [0,3]])
\end{pycode}

m2l = $\py{m2l(A)}$, 
\quad
wektor b = $\py{m2l(b)}$
\quad 
\subsection{Plots with matplotlib}

We can create plots with matplotlib, perfectly matching the plot fonts with the document fonts.  No more searching for the code that created a figure!

It is possible to pass page dimensions and similar contextual information from the \LaTeX\ side to the Python side.  If you want your figures to be, for example, a particular fraction of the page width, you can pass the value of \pygment{latex}{\textwidth} to the Python side, and use it in creating your figures.  See \pygment{latex}{\setpythontexcontext} in the main documentation for details.

You may want to use matplotlib's PGF backend when creating plots.

\begin{pyblock}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

setTeXLikeFonts(plt)

# plt.rc('text', usetex=True)
# plt.rc('font', family='serif')
# plt.rc('font', size=10.0)
# plt.rc('legend', fontsize=10.0)
# plt.rc('font', weight='normal')



x = np.linspace(0, 10)
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 2.5))
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), label='$\sin(x)$')
plt.xlabel(r'$x\mathrm{-axis}$')
plt.ylabel(r'$y\mathrm{-axis}$')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.savefig(figuresFolder+'myplot.pdf', bbox_inches='tight')
plt.savefig(figuresFolder+'myplot.png', bbox_inches='tight')
\end{pyblock}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{\figuresFolder myplot.pdf}
\end{center}

\verb|{setTeXLikeFonts(plt)}| function can be run only once per importing \verb|matplotlib.pyplot as plt| (probably the best place is just after import statement, in order to give matplotlib time to apply this settings before first plot rendering). 

When producing plots in a for loop you may need to consider to do it by using \verb|plt.subplots| command like below:

\begin{pyblock}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

setTeXLikeFonts(plt)

A = []
A.append(np.array([[-1,0],
               [0,-1]]))
A.append( np.array([[1/2,0],
               [0,1/3]]))
A.append( np.array([[0,-1],
               [1,0]]))

vectors = np.array([[1,2,  0],
                    [2,0, -3]])

cols = ['r','g','b', 'c','m','y','k']

vecNo = vectors.shape[1]

T = []
T.append( A[0] @ vectors )
T.append( A[1] @ vectors )
T.append( A[2] @ vectors )

n = 3

for i in range(n):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()    
    plt.xlim(-3, 3); plt.ylim(-3, 3) 
    for j in range(vecNo):
        ax.arrow(0,0,T[i][0,j], T[i][1,j], head_width=0.3, \
              head_length=0.5, length_includes_head=True, color = cols[j])

    plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
    plt.savefig(figuresFolder+'vectors_transformed_T'+str(i) +'.png',facecolor='w')
    
    plt.close()
    
\end{pyblock}

\includegraphics[width=7cm]{\figuresFolder vectors_transformed_T0.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{\figuresFolder vectors_transformed_T1.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{\figuresFolder vectors_transformed_T2.png}



\subsection{Using comments}

\subsubsection{'todo' package}
For short, inline comments or TODO comments use \verb|todo| package like this:
\MB{This is todo margin note}

\MBp{This is short inline comment}

%\MBe{This is old part of text}{Proposal of the new version}
\MBe{New}{Old}

\subsubsection{'comment' package}
For larger parts of the text use \verb|comment| environment. After defining the specific environments at the beginning of the document we can use them like this:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{private-comment}
This is a text with a private comment which will be excluded in the final, official version of the manuscript.
\end{private-comment}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{exercise}\
This is a text of an exercise that will be visible in the final version of the manuscript.

\end{exercise}

\begin{answers}
This a test of an answer that will be excluded from the final version of the manuscript.
\end{answers}
